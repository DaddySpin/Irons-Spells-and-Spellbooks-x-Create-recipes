# Irons Spells and Spellbooks x Create recipes
Provides recipes for Iron's spells and spellbooks scrolls using Create

Automatically creates recipes for all registered spells from base irons spells and all addons. there is 2 types of recipes, random output of same rarity and element or exact scroll crafting.

Addons are mostly compatible, you just need to add a dummy scroll and essence fluid for any new schools/elements of magic and any spells added to the default schools/elements will work out of the box. Alshanex's Familiars is already compatible since it is the only addon i use.

Spells scrolls have multiple crafting recipes and you can configure each spell to be crafted by random, master, both or uncraftable.

 * yes - spell is craftable in both ways
 * random - spell is craftable with a random output off the same rarity and element
 * master - spell is craftable with a master crafting paper by renaming the paper to the name of the spell and it will directly craft that spell
 * no - spell is uncraftable with this script

you can change these settings in the spell_crafting_modifications array spell_index.js, by default all spells are crafting
